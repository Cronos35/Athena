If you will be digital painting, it's best to learn how to use a graphic tablet because this will make make your digital painting a whole lot easier. This won't be needed if you'll be doing photo manipulation or vector graphics though, although a graphic tablet would still be of great help."

The job of the computer programmer is to translate a project’s requirements into software functionality to be achieved by the capabilities of the programming language, and solving logic problems develops an individual’s ability to solve problems by trial and error, theory development and testing, and hypotheses testing, which are all done very frequently in computer programming"

The interfaces of video games cater to a specific experience, and knowing what that experience is will help its user better understand the entirety of the game, which is one important task of a user interface designer"
